                <i>
                    I, Sam M. Suther agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024, 
                    ITIS 3135, Web Application Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. 
                    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the 
                    world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to 
                    keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or 
                    showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also 
                    understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples 
                    online or even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to 
                    learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external 
                    libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: Sam M. Suther, 30/11/2025
