            <p>
                Apple’s homepage is a clean, modern, and a polished website that highlights their
                products using strong visuals and a modern layout. Navigation is
                simple, which makes the user experience smooth and enjoyable. The site’s
                high-quality design clearly reflects Apple’s branding and attention to detail.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent contrast is used with bold product images, dark text on light backgrounds, and clear calls to action.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Fonts, spacing, buttons, and layout patterns repeat consistently, giving the page a unified look.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Every element is perfectly aligned using a clean grid, guiding the visitor’s eye down the page effortlessly.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements are grouped together (such as product info and images), while unrelated content is spaced apart.</li>

        <!-- BAD WEBSITE -->
        <section>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://art.yale.edu" target="_blank">
                    Yale School of Art (art.yale.edu)
                </a>
            </h3>

            <p>
                The Yale School of Art website is chaotic with cluttered design.
                It features inconsistent fonts, confusing color choices, and irregular layout sections
                that make the site difficult to read and navigate. Although the site contains useful
                information, the presentation makes it feel unorganized and overwhelming.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Many pages have poor contrast between text and background colors, making content difficult to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Almost no repetition exists fonts, colors, and layouts change randomly without a consistent style.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Alignment is chaotic; text and images are scattered unevenly with little visual structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Unrelated items are often placed too close together, while related items are spaced far apart, causing confusion.</li>
            </ul>
